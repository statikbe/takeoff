Takeoff
=======

A starter kit for an HTML project with Sass.

We use takeoff with our webpack boilerplate found [here](https://github.com/statikbe/webpack).
We normally put it inside **[root]/takeoff**

After you've copied the files into the correct folder, get the needed dependencies with `$ yarn install`. After all the needed packages are downloaded, you can start the build with:

```
$ yarn run watch
```

## Icons

You have to specify the **package.json** path in `takeoff/icons/iconfont.font.js`

takeoff
=======

A starter kit for an HTML project with sass. You can put this in any folder you like, we normally put it inside **<root>/takeoff**

After you've copied the files into the correct folder, get the needed dependencies with `$ npm install`. After all the needed packages are downloaded, you can run grunt with

```
$ grunt
```

Optionally you can specify a target with `--target=<target>`, the default target is **../application/public**. It will first build the whole project, en after that watch the takeoff folder for changes, and build when needed.
